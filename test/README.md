# A Day in My Alpha Life
> *"The lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep"*
## What I usually do
- **Wake up** at 4 in the morning ðŸŒž
- 3 hour run outside
- Check `Discord` and do my moderator duties
- **Transform** into my alpha wolf form
- Watch edits of myself for 5 hours

## A very hard Python snippet I wrote today
```python
for alpha in range(100000):
    if alpha = skibidi and alpha != beta and alpha % 2 == 0:
        print(str(alpha) + " is me")
    else:
        print("oh..")
```

## Some thoughts on math
The Pythagorean Theorem, $a^2+b^2=c^2$ is NOT REAL. Triangles are ONLY A THING in your imagination.

And here's a block equation :3
$$
\varphi(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-x^2/2} 
\tag{1}
$$

Sometimes I DON'T NOTICE patterns like
$$
\begin{align*}
a_n &\asymp b_n\\
&\sim c_n
\end{align*}
$$
